# DragRacer
Predict and keep up-to-date with the results of RuPaul's Drag Race

## Features
With this app, the user initially views all contestents and predicts who he or she thinks will be the overall winnner of the season. This will leave a timestamp with that prediction. As the season progresses, the user can tell the app who was eliminated, the contestent will be removed from the list, and the user can then update their prediction.

## How is it made?
This application was made using Javascript and styled with CSS on the front end. The back end was created with Ruby on Rails.

## Getting Started
### Connecting to the API
Open the DragRacer back end repo, hosted by Heroku and found [here](https://dragracer.herokuapp.com/), before running. The backend will run on localhost/3000./

### Installing
Run the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

### Accessing the APP
You are now ready to use the app in your browser!

Happy drag racing
